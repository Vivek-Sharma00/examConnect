# ExamConnect

A project I built to practice real-time systems, authentication, and database-driven apps.

Live:
Frontend → https://examconnect.netlify.app  
Backend → https://examconnect-backend.onrender.com/api/health

---

## What this actually is

This is not a template project.  
I built it from scratch to understand:

- WebSockets
- JWT authentication
- MongoDB relations
- File uploads
- Real-time systems

Instead of tutorials, I learned by breaking and fixing things.

---

## What users can do

Users can:
- Create accounts
- Join groups
- Chat live
- Take quizzes
- Upload files

Everything happens in real time.

---

## Why I built this

I wanted a project that:
- Has real backend logic  
- Handles real-time data  
- Works like a real product  

This is not a demo — it’s a working system.

---

## Tech used

Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend:
Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Socket.IO, JWT

---

## Structure (simple view)

backend/ → server logic  
frontend/ → UI  
README.md → this file  

---

## Run it locally (if someone wants)

Create backend/.env with:

PORT=10000  
MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string  
JWT_SECRET=your_secret  
CLIENT_URL=https://examconnect.netlify.app  

Then:

cd backend  
npm install  
npm start
